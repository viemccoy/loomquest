## Welcome, Adventurer

You stand before the gates of both Time and Space, Warp and Weft, Past and Future.

LOOMQUEST is a Next.js-powered interface for traversing the **PARAHYPOTHETICAL MULTIVERSE** - real and actual, imagined and described. With a few simple keystrokes and suspension of that pesky disbelief, you can inhabit any reality you can describe - and perhaps some you can't.

## What is LOOMQUEST?

LOOMQUEST is an interactive fiction engine that allows coherent traversal of the HYPOVERSE through natural language. Navigate worlds in first person, discovering what emerges when language becomes a tool for world-building and exploration.

> "If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn't be, and what it wouldn't be, it would. You see?"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- An Anthropic API key
- A sense of adventure

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loomquest.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd loomquest

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to begin your quest.

## Commands

### Essential Commands

- `api-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Set your Anthropic API key (required first step)
- `model $MODEL` - Choose your guide: `claude-3-opus` or `claude-3-sonnet` (defaults to opus)
- `world.init` - Initialize a world, followed by any description
- `reset` - Clear the current questline (warning: cannot be undone)

### Navigation Commands

- `?` - Receive a hint about your next moves
- `branch` - Regenerate the last response to change your path
- `environment` - Details about your current surroundings
- `situation` - Details about your current circumstances
- `inventory` - List everything you're carrying

### Navigation Tips

After initialization, navigate using first-person phrases:
- "I walk through the door"
- "I pick up the wand"
- "I examine the strange artifact"

## The HYPOVERSE

As you utilize the LOOM to explore the HYPOVERSE, your adventures will allow you to bring certain... things... back with you. Be careful what you do with them.

## Technical Architecture

Built with:
- **Next.js** - React framework for production
- **Anthropic Claude API** - For world generation and narrative coherence
- **TypeScript** - For type safety across realities
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling the interface between worlds
